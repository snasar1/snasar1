    Shipping companies often charge extra for boxes that are large but very light, basing the fee on volume instead of weight.
    The usual method to compute the “dimensional weight” is to divide the volume by 166 (the allowable number of cubic inches per pound). 

Write a C program in a file called task_three.c that computes and displays the dimensional weight of a particular box. 
Test your code with the following Dimensions: 12x10x8
